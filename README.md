## Watched

Watched is an app that is designed to make it easier to track media you have already seen. It stems from my own desire to track the media I've consumed, all in one place. 

Users can search for Shows or Movies and add them to a convenient list that can track season progress, episode progress, completion status, and the time in the show or movie you paused or stopped watching.
